    <h1> WorldWideWeb - Summary</h1>

<p>The WWW project merges information retrieval and hypertext techniques to create an easy but powerful global information system.</p>
<p>The project is based on the philosophy that much academic information should be freely available to anyone. The objective is to allow the sharing of information in internationally dispersed teams and the dissemination of information by support groups. Originally aimed at the high-energy physics community, it has spread to other areas and attracted a lot of interest in user support, resource discovery and collaborative work areas.</p></br>
<p>Reader view</p></br>
<p>The world of the WWW consists of documents and links. Indexes are special documents that, instead of being read, can be searched. The result of this search is another ("virtual") document that contains links to the documents found. A simple protocol ("HTTP") is used to allow a browser program to request a keyword search for a remote information server.</p>   
<p>The web contains documents in various formats. Hypertext documents (real or virtual) contain links to other documents or locations within the documents. All documents, real, virtual or index, look similar to the reader and are contained in the same addressing scheme.</p></br>
<p>To follow a link, the reader clicks with the mouse (or types a number if he doesn't have the mouse). To search and index, a reader provides keywords (or other search criteria). These are the only operations required to access the entire world of data.</p></br>

<p>Information provider view</p></br>
<p>WWW browsers can access many existing data systems through existing protocols (FTP, NNTP) or via HTTP and a gateway. In this way, the critical mass of data is quickly exceeded and the increasing use of the system by readers and information providers is encouraged.</p>
<p>Creating a web is as simple as writing some SGML files that point to existing data. Making it public involves running the FTP or HTTP daemon and creating at least one link on the web from another. In fact, any file available via anonymous FTP can be immediately linked to a web. The small initial effort was designed to allow small contributions. At the other end of the scale, large information providers can provide an HTTP server with full-text or keyword indexing. This can allow access to a large existing database without changing the way the database is managed. These gateways have already been transformed into Digital's VMS / Help systems, Graz's "Hyper-G" Technical University and Thinking Machine's "WAIS" systems.</p></br>
<p>The WWW model overcomes the frustrating data format incompatibilities between suppliers and readers, allowing formats to be negotiated between a smart browser and a smart server. This should provide a foundation for multimedia extension and allow those who share application patterns to make full use of them on the web.</p></br>
<p>This summary does not describe the many interesting possibilities opened up by the WWW project, such as efficient document caching. the reduction of outdated redundant copies and the use of knowledge daemons. There is more information in the online project documentation, including some hypertext information and many technical notes.</p></br>
<p>Try it</p></br>
<p>You can try the single-line browser by telnetting to info.cern.ch (no username or password. In UK JANET, use the Gateway). You can also find out more about the WWW this way. This is the least sophisticated browser - remember that window-oriented people are much smarter!</p>
<p>It is much more efficient to install a browser on your own machine. The line mode browser is currently available in anonymous FTP source format on the info.cern.ch node [currently 128.141.201.74] as</p></br>
                        <ul>/pub/www/src/WWWLineMode_v.vv.tar.Z.</ul></br>
<p>v.vv is the version number - get the latest one.) Also available is a hypertext editor for NeXT (WWWNeXTStepEditor_v.vv.tar.Z), the ViolaWWW browser for X11 and a skeleton server daemon (WWWDaemon_v.vv.tar.Z).</p></br>
<p>The documentation can be read using www. A plain text version of the installation instructions is included in the tar! The documentation and printable articles (postscript) are at / pub / www / doc</p>
