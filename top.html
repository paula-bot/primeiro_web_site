   <h1>Overview</h1>

<p>There is no "top" for the World Wide Web. You can see it from many points of view. If you have no other bias, here are some ways to look for information.</p><br>
<p>by subject</p>
    <ul>A classification by subject of interest. Incomplete, but easier to use.</ul><br>
<p>by type</p>
    <ul>Searching by type of service (access protocol, etc.) can allow you to find things, if you know what you are looking for.</ul><br>
<p>If you need to use a "top" node, we recommend this node or the subject list. See also: About the W3 project.</p>
