    <h1>WWW people</h1>

<p>This is a list of some of those who contributed to the WWW project and whose work is linked to this website. Unless otherwise stated, they are at CERN, phone +41 (22) 767 plus the extension provided below or look for them in the phone book. Address: 1211 Geneva 23, Switzerland. See also: Assistants in SLAC. Eelco van Asperen Ported the line mode browser on the PC on PC-NFS; developed a version of curses. E-mail: evas@cs.few.eur.nl.</p>
    <p>Carl Barker</p>
<p>Carl is at CERN for a period of six months during his undergraduate course at Brunel University, UK. Carl will be working on the server side, possibly on client authentication. Tel: 8265. E-mail: barker@cernnext.cern.ch Tim Berners-Lee Currently in the CN division. Before joining CERN, Tim worked, among other things, on document production and word processing. He developed his first hypertext system, "Inquire", in 1980, for his own use (although he is not aware of the existence of the term HyperText). With experience in word processing, software and real-time communications, Tim decided that high-energy physics needed a networked hypertext system and CERN was the ideal place to develop hypertext ideas for wide areas. Tim started the WorldWideWeb project at CERN in 1989. He wrote the application on NeXT along with most of the communication software. Telephone: 3755, E-mail: timbl@info.cern.ch</p><br>
    <p>Robert Cailliau</p>
<p>reviously in programming language design and compiler building, Robert has been interested in document production since 1975, when he designed and implemented a widely used document formatting and marking system. He headed CERN's Office Computing Systems group, 87-89. He is a longtime user of Hypercard, which he used for purposes as diverse as writing travel reports, games, accounting software and budget preparation forms. When he is not working on WWW public relations, Robert is contributing browser software to the Macintosh platform and analyzing the needs for physics experiments to access online data. Telephone: +41 (22) 767 50 05, E-mail: cailliau@cernnext.cern.ch Dan Connolly One of the early followers of the project, Dan wrote a private X-Windows editor for his company and encouraged the use of suitable SGML and MIME in the future. He wrote a DTD for HTML and an HTML legalizer for old files. Email: connolly@pixel.convex.com.</p><br>
    <p>Peter Dobberstein</p>
<p>While in the DESY lab in Hamburg (DE), Peter ported the line mode browser to MVS and, indirectly, to VM / CMS. These were the most difficult ports to date. He also overcame many incidental problems by making a large amount of information available in the DESY database."Erwise" team Kim Nyberg, Teemu Rantanen, Kati Suominen and Kari Syd {nmaanlakka ('{' is 'a' with a colon above it. We need to insert a description of the character set in HTML!) (Under the supervision of Ari Lemmke) are "Erwise "At the Technical University of Helsinki, they are writing a Motif-based WWW browser (editor? We can wait ...) for their graduation project in the last year. The team can be contacted as erwise@cs.hut.fi and Ari as arl@cs.hut.fi.Alain Favre</p>
<p>Alain is a graduate student who works with ECP / PT in a browser for Windows on PCs. Phone: 8265, no e-mail yet. At CERN, especially in the afternoon.</p><br>
    <p>David Foster</p>
<p>With extensive experience in current belief systems and networks and PC / Windows being the way of the future, Dave is participating in an MS-Windows browser / editor. Dave also has a strong interest in server technology and intelligent information retrieval algorithms.</p><br>
    <p>Jean-Francois Groff</p>
<p>Provided some useful information about "design problems". During his stay at CERN as a "cooperator", JF joined the project in September 1991. He wrote the gateway to the VMS Help system, worked on the new modular browser architecture and helped support and present the WWW at all levels . Now he is porting the communication code to DECnet, in order to configure servers for physical experiments. JF now works for NeXT Europe, but continues his interest on the web ... (Contact)</p><br>
    <p>Tony Johnson</p>
<p>Tel: (415) 926 2278, TONYJ@scs.slac.stanford.edu.</p>
<p>MidasWWW Designer. Boston University, collaborating with SLAC, SSC, etc. A SLAC server specialist and a WWWizard.</p><br>
    <p>Paul Kunz</p>
<p>Paul took the word W3 to SLAC, installed clients and inspired the installation of servers by WWWizards. Paul spreads enthusiasm for all kinds of good ideas, like OO programming, NeXTs, etc ...</p><br>
    <p>Willem van Leeuwen</p>
<p>at NIKHEF, WIllem installed many servers and provided many useful comments on browser code</p><br>
    <p>Nicola Pellow</p>
<p>With the project from November 1990 to August 1991 and October 1992 to ??. A graduate of Leicester Polytechnic in the United Kingdom, Nicola wrote the original line mode browser. (More) Nicola is now (October 92) working on the Mac browser.</p><br>
    <p>Bernd Pollermann</p>
<p>Bernd is responsible for the "XFIND" indexes on the CERNVM node, for its operation and, in large part, for its content. He is also the editor of Computer Newsletter (CNL) and has experience in managing large information databases. Bernd is part of the AS group in the CN division. He contributed code to the FIND server, which allows hypertext access to this large repository of information. Telephone: 2407, Office: 513-1-16, E-mail: bernd@cernvm.cern.ch</p><br>
    <p>Arthur Secret</p>
<p>A student at CERN during August and September 1992, Arthur wrote the first W3-Oracle gateway.</p><br>
    <p>Streets of Jonthan</p>
<p>Online support group, FNAL. Jonathan installed a VMS server using DCL and later C. He helped to debug the Mac browser.</p><br>
    <p>Pei Wei</p>
<p>Pei is the author of "Viola", a hypertext browser, and the variant ViolaWWW, which is a WWW browser. He was at the University of California at Berkeley, Experimental Computing Facility, now full time with O'Reilly and Associates, Sebastopol, CA, USA. Email: wei@xcf.berkeley.edu</p><br>
    <p>Bebo White</p>
<p>one of WWAC's SLAC assistants, Bebo enthusiastically spreads the word. During a short stay at CERN in the summer of 92, Bebo installed several servers to obtain information from the Aleph experiment.</p><br>
