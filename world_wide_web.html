<p>The "WorldWideWeb" application for NeXT is a hypertext browser / editor model. It allows direct access to servers, files and hypertext news. See also more information:</p>

<p>General</p><br>
<p>When you double-click the WorldWideWeb icon, or by default, your own home page, ~ / WWW / default.html, or, failing that, on the system's home page, / usr / local / lib / WWW / default. html</p>
<p>From then on, you can select a document referred to by a page being displayed, double click on a gray text area. (Gray was chosen not to use other prominent techniques, such as bold or italics, which authors may want to use for other things. When a color appears, we can use a color ...)</p><br>
<p>If you double-click anywhere else in the document, select a word, as is usual in NeXT.</p><br>
<p>Some gray areas carry entire documents, while others display a document with an actual specific target area. This is called the target anchor. It does not turn gray unless it takes you somewhere else for a while, but double-clicking on a target anchor selects an entire anchor..</p><br>
<p>Indexes.</p><br>
<p>Certain documents are indexes. They usually have only a small amount of text. You cannot read the index on your own (it can be very large). To access something through the index, use the "Search by keyword" menu option. The index window should be the dark main window (dark title bar) when you use the keyword search panel. The rules used by the match search indexes used. Different indexes use different techniques and cover different ranges of information. When a search is successful, the result is a document reference page. You select documents by double-clicking in the usual way..</p></br>
